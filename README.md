Locations Code - The 8-Character Universal Delivery Address System

The codes are unique worldwide, always maintaining the 8-character format, and each code is 102 feet wide. They are a more stable, precise, and efficient alternative to traditional postal codes.

They are independent of administrative area variations and national languages, and highlight nearby locations: these features are more advantageous than similar tools like Google's Plus Code or What3words.

The customer, using their smartphone, retrieves the "Locations Code" of their delivery point and enters it in the order; the courier, scanning it with their terminal, will be guided, without hesitation, to the same location.

For example, the address "Portland Head Light - 12 Captain Strout Cir, Cape Elizabeth, ME 04107 USA" is coded with "ECA3-6XD2" which indicates the coordinates 43.623056, -70.208333
